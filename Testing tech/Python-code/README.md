# Python Interview Coding Examples

This repo contains Python solutions to classic interview problems:

- Loops (for, while, simulated do-while)
- Conditional statements (if/else, match-case)
- Lists/Arrays (min/max, sum, remove duplicates, equality)
- Strings (reverse, palindrome, anagram, char count)
- Linked Lists (reverse, detect cycle)
- Recursion (factorial, fibonacci, tower of hanoi)
- Dictionaries/Sets (find duplicates, pairs with sum)
